# IPL win probability predictor and Exploratory data analysis.

In this project an IPL win preobability predictor is made using machine learning algorithims like Logistic regression and Random Forest classifier. It was found that Logistic regression algorithim gives a better prediction of the match result compared to Random Forest Classifier.

Also performing Exploratory Data Analysis in the datasets has provided various insights of IPL matches like top run scores, top wicket takers, matches played each season, most toss winners etc.

I have used IPL datasest from Kaggle in this project. It contains two csv files 'matches.csv' and 'deliveries.csv'.
